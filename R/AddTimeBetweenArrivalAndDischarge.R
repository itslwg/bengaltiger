#' Add time between arrival and discharge
#'
#' Adds the variable time between arrival to and discharge from participating
#' centre.
#' @param study.sample Data frame. The study sample. No default.
#' @param from.date Character or POSIXt vector of length 1. The name of the
#'     variable with the date from which to start counting. Defaults to "doar".
#' @param from.time Character or POSIXt vector of length 1. The name of the
#'     variable with the time from which to start counting. Defaults to "toar".
#' @param to.date Character or POSIXt vector of length 1. The name of the
#'     variable with the date from which to start counting. Defaults to "dodd".
#' @param to.time Character or POSIXt vector of length 1. The name of the
#'     variable with the time from which to start counting. Defaults to "todd".
#' @param date.format Character vector of length 1. The date format. Defaults to
#'     "\%Y-\%m-\%d".
#' @param time.format Character vector of length 1. The date format. Defaults to
#'     "\%H:\%M".
#' @param units Character vector of length 1. Should be one of "days", "hours",
#'     "minutes", or "seconds". Defaults to "days".
#' @param variable.name Character vector of length 1. The name of the time
#'     between injury and arrival variable. Defaults to "tadd".
#' @param drop.used.variables Logical vector of length 1. If TRUE the date and
#'     time variables used to calculate time between injury and arrival are
#'     dropped from the sample. Defaults to TRUE.
