#' Add specific injury variable
#'
#' Adds a new indicator variable to the study sample, defining what patients had
#' the specific injury or injury pattern provided.
#' @param study.sample Data frame. The study sample. No default.
#' @param injury.codes Character vector. The patterns to be used to define the
#'     specific injury or injury pattern. If any of the codes is present in any
#'     of the variables listen in injury.variables an observation will be
#'     classified as having the injury. No default.
#' @param variable.name Character vector of length 1. The name of the
#'     variable. No default.
#' @param injury.variables Character vector. The names of the variables with
#'     injudy data. Defaults to c("e_1_icd", "e_2_icd", "e_3_icd", "e_4_icd",
#'     "e_5_icd", "e_6_icd", "e_7_icd", "e_8_icd", "e_9_icd", "e_10_icd",

#'     "op_11_icd").
#' @param levels Character vector of length 2. The levels to use to encode the
#'     resulting injury variable. The first item in the vector should be the
#'     level to be used to represent having the injury. Defaults to c("Yes",
#'     "No").
#' @param add.as.factor Logical vector of length 1. If TRUE the variable is
#'     added to the study sample as a factor. If FALSE it is added as
#'     character. Defaults to TRUE.
#' @param drop.used.variables Logical vector of length 1. If TRUE the injury
#'     variables used to calculate the injury variable are dropped from the
#'     sample. Defaults to FALSE.
